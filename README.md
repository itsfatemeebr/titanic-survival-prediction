Predicting passenger survival using machine learning models and data analysis (Kaggle dataset)
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset (from Kaggle) to build predictive models for passenger survival based on attributes like gender, age, class, etc.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (e.g., age, embarked)
- Feature encoding (e.g., gender → numeric)
- Creating new features like "FamilySize"

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## 📊 Evaluation
All models were evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix. Random Forest provided the best accuracy on validation data.

## 📌 Insights
- Female passengers had a higher chance of survival
- Passengers in higher classes survived more frequently
- Family size had an impact on survival rates
